Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game!

How to Play:

- Download both `gserver.py` and `gclient.py`.
- Run the server code (`gserver.py`) in your Python IDE.
- Open your command prompt (cmd) and go to the directory containing `gclient.py`.
- Open the client code by typing: `python gclient.py`.
- Once the client code is running, follow the prompts to input your guesses.
- The server will generate a random number, and your task is to guess it within a certain range.
- If you guess the correct number, you win the game!

Reminder:
- Both `gserver.py` and `gclient.py` must be in the same directory.
- You need Python installed on your system to run the code.
